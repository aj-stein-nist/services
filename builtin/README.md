This package implements "built in" version of plugin loader and manager (see
[Veraison plugin framework](../plugin). This removes runtime plugin discovery
and loading (and, thus, any potential security issues associated with running
external executables).

Instead, plugins are "discovered" at build time by iterating over an array of
plugin implementations defined inside [schemes.gen.go](schemes.gen.go), which,
in turn, can be (re-)generated by running [gen-schemes](../scripts/gen-schemes)
script.

> **Note**: `gen-schemes` script repeatedly invokes `gopls` and `guru` in order
> to identify plugin implementations. This means that it is very slow. Because of
> this, a static version of `schemes.gen.go` is currently submitted as part of
> the source.
